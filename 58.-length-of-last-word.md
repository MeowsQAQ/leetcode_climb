# 58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters `' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Note:** A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

**Example:**

```text
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if(" " in s):
            tmp = s.split(" ")
            for i in range(len(tmp) - 1, -1, -1):
                if len(tmp[i]) != 0:
                    return len(tmp[i])
            return 0
        else:
            return len(s)
```
