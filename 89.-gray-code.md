# 89. Gray Code

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

```python
class Solution(object):
    def grayCode(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not n:
            return [0]
        res = [0,1]
        for i in range(2,n+1):
            for j in range(len(res)-1,-1,-1):
                res.append(res[j] | 1<<i-1)
        return res
```
