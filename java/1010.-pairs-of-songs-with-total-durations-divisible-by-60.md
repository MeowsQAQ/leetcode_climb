# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60



In a list of songs, the `i`-th song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by `60`.  Formally, we want the number of indices `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= time.length <= 60000`
2. `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

```text
class Solution {
  public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {

    int count = 0;
    int[] counter = new int[60];
    for (int t : time) {
        int remainder = t % 60;             //余数
        if (remainder == 0) 
            count += counter[remainder];    //如60,120,180这些只能相互成对。
        else if (counter[60-remainder] > 0){
            count += counter[60-remainder]; //如30,150
        }
        counter[remainder]++;
    }
    return count;
}
}
```
