# 38.Count and Say

38. Count and SayEasy7085419FavoriteShare

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```text
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        s = '1'
        for _ in range(n-1):
            let, temp, count = s[0], '', 0
            for l in s:
                if let == l:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    temp += str(count)+let
                    let = l
                    count = 1
            temp += str(count)+let
            s = temp
        return s
        
# count计数
# 遇到新数，将之前合起来，直接计数count=1
```
