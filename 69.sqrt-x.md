# 69.Sqrt（x）

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if x==1: return 1 #deal with exception
        l, r = 0, x
        while l <= r:
            mid = (r+l)//2
            if mid * mid <= x < (mid+1)*(mid+1):
                return mid
            elif x < mid * mid:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid
```
