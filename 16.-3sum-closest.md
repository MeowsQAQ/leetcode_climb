# 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**

```text
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Code:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        res = []
        nums.sort()
        closestDiff = sys.maxsize  #9223372036854775807
        sign = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            l, r = i+1, len(nums)-1
            
            while l < r:
                s = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if s == target:
                    return s
                if abs(target - s) < closestDiff:
                    sign = -1 if target - s < 0 else 1
                closestDiff = min(abs(target - s), closestDiff)
                if s < target:
                    l +=1 
                elif s > target:
                    r -= 1
        return target - (closestDiff * sign)
```
