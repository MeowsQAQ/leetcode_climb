# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the _n_-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```text
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given _n_ will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?

### Code:

```text
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        self.next, nodelist  = head, [self]
        while head.next:
            if len(nodelist) == n:
                nodelist.pop(0)
            nodelist += head,
            head = head.next
        nodelist[0].next = nodelist[0].next.next 
        return self.next
        
```
