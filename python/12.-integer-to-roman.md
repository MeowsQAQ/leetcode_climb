# 12. Integer to Roman

 Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` \(5\) and `X` \(10\) to make 4 and 9. 
* `X` can be placed before `L` \(50\) and `C` \(100\) to make 40 and 90. 
* `C` can be placed before `D` \(500\) and `M` \(1000\) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```text
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

### Code:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        roman = [["", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"],
                 ["", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"],
                 ["", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"], 
                 ["", "M", "MM", "MMM"]]
        res = []
        res.append(roman[3][(num // 1000) ]) # 向列表尾端添加一个新的元素
        res.append(roman[2][(num //100) % 10])
        res.append(roman[1][(num // 10) % 10])
        res.append(roman[0][num % 10])
        return "".join(res)  
        # 以""相连形成一个新字符串,Input：3999,Output:MMMCMXCIX
        # 如果return res 则输出["MMM","CM","XC","IX"] 
```
