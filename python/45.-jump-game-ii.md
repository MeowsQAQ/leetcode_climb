# 45. Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Note:**

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Codeï¼š

This problem has a nice BFS structure. Let's illustrate it using the example `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]` in the problem statement. We are initially at position `0`. Then we can move at most `nums[0]` steps from it. So, after one move, we may reach `nums[1] = 3` or `nums[2] = 1`. So these nodes are reachable in `1` move. From these nodes, we can further move to `nums[3] = 1` and `nums[4] = 4`. Now you can see that the target `nums[4] = 4` is reachable in `2` moves.

Putting these into codes, we keep two pointers `start` and `end` that record the current range of the starting nodes. Each time after we make a move, update `start` to be `end + 1` and `end` to be the farthest index that can be reached in `1` move from the current `[start, end]`.

```python
class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @return {integer}
    def jump(self, nums):
        n, start, end, step = len(nums), 0, 0, 0
        while end < n - 1:
            step += 1
            maxend = end + 1
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                if i + nums[i] >= n - 1:
                    return step
                maxend = max(maxend, i + nums[i])
            start, end = end + 1, maxend
        return step
```
