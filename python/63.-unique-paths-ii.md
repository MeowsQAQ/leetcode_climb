# 63. Unique Paths II

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not obstacleGrid:
            return 
        r, c = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        cur = [0] * c
        cur[0] = 1 - obstacleGrid[0][0]
        for i in range(1, c):
            cur[i] = cur[i-1] * (1 - obstacleGrid[0][i])
        for i in range(1, r):
            cur[0] *= (1 - obstacleGrid[i][0])
            for j in range(1, c):
                cur[j] = (cur[j-1] + cur[j]) * (1 - obstacleGrid[i][j])
        return cur[-1]
```
