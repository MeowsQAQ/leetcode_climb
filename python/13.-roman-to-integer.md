# 13. Roman to Integer

 Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` \(5\) and `X` \(10\) to make 4 and 9. 
* `X` can be placed before `L` \(50\) and `C` \(100\) to make 40 and 90. 
* `C` can be placed before `D` \(500\) and `M` \(1000\) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```text
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```
