# 64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a _m_ x _n_ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which _minimizes_ the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Code：

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        for i in range(1, n):
            grid[0][i] += grid[0][i-1]
        for i in range(1, m):
            grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
        return grid[-1][-1]
        
```
