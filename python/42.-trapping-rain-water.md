# 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given _n_ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)  
The above elevation map is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water \(blue section\) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

**Example:**

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        waterLevel = []
        left = 0
        for h in height:
            left = max(left, h) 
            waterLevel += [left] # over-fill it to left max height
        right = 0
        for i, h in reversed(list(enumerate(height))):
            right = max(right, h)
            waterLevel[i] = min(waterLevel[i], right) - h # drain to the right height
        return sum(waterLevel)
```
