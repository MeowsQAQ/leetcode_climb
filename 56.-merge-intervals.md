# 56. Merge Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

**NOTE:** input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        out = []
        for i in sorted(intervals, key=lambda i: i[0]):
            if out and i[0] <= out[-1][1]:
                out[-1][1] = max(out[-1][1], i[1])
            else:
                out += i,
        return out
```
